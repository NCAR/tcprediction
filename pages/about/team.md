[Dr. Jonathan Vigh](https://staff.ral.ucar.edu/jvigh/) (Project Scientist I, Research Applications Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research) works at the intersection of atmospheric science, data science, and weather/climate risk. Dr. Vigh has expertise in tropical meteorology and tropical cyclone dynamics. Dr. Vigh has studied the problem of eye formation in hurricanes to learn how the eye/eyewall structure impacts the subsequent intensification of the storm. Dr. Vigh has also done extensive work to construct [aircraft-based data sets](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/tcdata/flight/) and a [historical database](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/tcdata/historical/) to further investigate structure and intensity changes in tropical cyclones, with a particular focus on the radius of maximum winds (RMW). Dr. Vigh is the lead developer of the [Tropical Cyclone Guidance Project (TCGP)](http://hurricanes.ral.ucar.edu/) and the [Climate Risk Management engine (CRMe)](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/jntweb/crme/). Dr. Vigh is the Principal Investigator of the HurricaneRiskCalculator project, leads the Wind Modeling and Verification and Validation teams. 


### Project Co-Principal Investigators


#### Christopher Rozoff

Dr. Christopher Rozoff (Project Scientist, Research Applications Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research) conducts research on global, mesoscale, and tropical cyclone forecasting methods and validation and also works with mesoscale and LES modeling, machine learning methods, and remote sensing applications.


#### Eric Hendricks

Dr. Eric Hendricks is a project scientist at the Research Applications Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He has a B.S.E. degree from the University of Michigan in Mechanical Engineering and M.S./Ph.D. degrees in Atmospheric Science from Colorado State University. Dr. Hendricks has expertise in tropical cyclones, tropical meteorology, numerical weather prediction (focus on mesoscale and large-eddy-simulation modeling), numerical methods, atmospheric dynamics, boundary-layer meteorology, and urban meteorology. Dr. Hendricks has authored or co-authored over 40 refereed publications and 100 conference presentations. Dr. Hendricks plans to contribute to wind hazard modeling in urban environments to support the HurricaneRiskCalculator.
